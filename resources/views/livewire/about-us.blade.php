                        <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-800">I came to Albania with my partner for a holiday.</p>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-800">However when I got here I was shocked of to see how badly dogs and cats are treated in this country... Often abandoned and left to send for themselves in the streets, where they are often abused, neglected and sometimes tortured for amusement. No food water or shelter..</p>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-800">Thus, I have spent the last 5 year feeding stray dogs and cats getting them medical treatment and doing everything I can to try to get these poor strays adopted out to good homes.</p>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-800">My <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100079156959711">Facebook</a> pages, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfl4YekaXpdXzS2MdkVSeYg">Youtube</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@marlindaangelstraydogs">Tiktok</a> channels documents the work I have been doing with these strays for the last 5 years.</p>

                            I have been doing this and mostly on my own with little to no help from any of these so called agencies that claim to care about animals.
                        </P>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-800">
                            Unfortunately currently, I no longer have a source of revenue to help these animals besides donations now and then.

                        <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-800">
                            I am not about making a profit of these animals. I actually care about their lives and well being.
                        </P>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-800">
                            However, I simply cannot abandon the animals. I am so desperately trying to help.

                            Currently September 2023 I have found 23 awesome families in The Netherlands and Belgium for 23 awesome beautiful souls from Albania.

                            It is my hope and prayer that you will adopt one of my dogs or assist me by donating or sheltering, fostering them and helping me to get them adopted out.
                        </P>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-800">
                            I emplore... No. I beg you to help me save these animals because they are beautiful little souls who are worthy of life.

                            Currently I have 8 dogs (plus my dog is 9) in my home and garden that need adoption. They are my babies and I am really attached to them. They are all very sweet and adorable good dogs.
                            All dogs will have all the required vaccinations, deworming anti parasite treatments, will be sterilized, rabies test and documents for travel.
                        </P>
                        <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-800">
                            No matter in which country you are, I will bring your baby to you.
